The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` will work as expected, but if you use a space between the percentage and the minus sign like this: `width: calc(100% - 10px);`, it'll cause an error in some browsers.  Another issue is using units inconsistently within the `calc()` function (e.g., mixing 'px' and 'em' without proper conversion).
